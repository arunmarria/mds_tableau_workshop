## Seminar Outline

1. **Slides -> Introduce Tableau: What it is? Who uses it? Why?** (2 mins)
    - How Hayley learned Tableau: 
         - Videos were not helpful for me. Very Slock Tried sitting through their intro course and immediately lost interest. 
         - I needed a task, a specific goal and then off I went. I recommend the same.
1. **Slides -> Gallery of Tableau Dashboard** (2 mins) 
1. **Slides -> Pros and Cons** (5 mins) 
    - Pros: 
      - Super easy to use
      - Drag and drop style
      - Lot you can do easily
      - Things that would take a while on Altair and ggplot can be done easily
      - Extensions are useful
      - It's pretty
      - Super easy to connect to ddatabases - postgres db
      - Wrangling in Tableau is possible
      - Multiple data sources
        
    - Cons
      - Easy stuff in visualization world take longer to do in Tableau (Violin plots)
      - "Crap for big data"
      - Problematic for "specific things" -> Tableau has rules they expect you to follow and getting around them is hacky. 
      - There are some "calculations"
      - Steep learning curves (couple hours)
      - Expensive, academic license is restrictive
      - NOT reproducible
      - (lack of) Version Control (image of folders) 
      - Crashes... a lot. 

1. **Introduce Dummy Dash** (6 mins) 
    - What is capable in 1 month time 
    - Features 
    - Captions 
    - Filtering
    - Dashboard vs sheet(?) 
    - Pop ups, hovers ,extensions, palettes
    - URLs, images 

1. **Slides -> Vocabulary** (6 mins) 
    - Dimension, measure, parameter, (continuous vs discrete),  calculation, etc.
    - Worksheets vs dashboards
    - Tableau recognizes locations, time, boolean, strings etc (different than dimensions)
    - Table JOINS!!! relationship vs join (I still don't understand the difference here) 
    - `.Twb` vs `.Twbx`
    - 

1. **Workshop building quick plots** (15 mins) (maybe more if possible) 
    (need to explore this more) 
    - Bring in data (joins and combined data) 
    - Use Vancouver trees dataset 
    - Make bar chart, bubble chart, time series (forcasting option- do not love, but it's there)!
    - Map, layers 
    - Filtering 
    - Difficulties of easy things (discrete values top header vs continuous values = bottom header, horizontal radio buttons)
    - Aggregates, different symbols (can add your own!) 

1. **Slides -> Python/Jupyter with Tableau** (6-8 mins)
    - [TabPy](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/11/leverage-power-python-tableau-tabpy-62077)
    - [Jupyter notebook and Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/1/building-advanced-analytics-applications-tabpy-64916)
