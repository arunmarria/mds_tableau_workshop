        - Pros: 
          - Super easy to use
          - Drag and drop style
          - Lot you can do easily
          - Things that would take a while on Altair and ggplot can be done easily

          - Super easy to connect to ddatabases - postgres db
          - Wrangling in Tableau is possible
          - Multiple data sources

        - Cons
          - Easy stuff in visualization world take longer to do in Tableau (Violin plots)
          - "Crap for big data"
          - Problematic for "specific things" -> Tableau has rules they expect you to follow and getting around them is hacky. 
          - There are some "calculations"
          - Steep learning curves (couple hours)
          - Expensive, academic license is restrictive
          - NOT reproducible
          - (lack of) Version Control (image of folders) 
          - Crashes... a lot. 

1. **Demo - Part 1: Dummy Dash** (5 mins) 
    - What is possible in 1 month time 
    - Features 
    - Captions

    - Pop ups, hovers, extensions, palettes
    - URLs, images 

1. **Slides -> Vocabulary** (5 mins)

    - `.Twb` vs `.Twbx`
    
1. **Demo - Part 2: Dummy Dash** (5 mins) 

    - Move some stuff Part 1 demo here

1. **Workshop - Building a dashboard from scratch** (30 mins)
    (need to explore this more) 
    - Bring in data (joins and combined data) 
    - Use Vancouver trees dataset 
    - Make bar chart, bubble chart, time series (forcasting option- do not love, but it's there)!
    - Map, layers 
    - Filtering 
    - Difficulties of easy things (discrete values top header vs continuous values = bottom header, horizontal radio buttons)
    - Aggregates, different symbols (can add your own!)

1. **Questions - at the end and throughout** (10 mins)

(Current time ~ 50 mins) 

1. Troubleshooting and/or general dashboard consulation session (60 mins)

### Optional Slides/content

1. **Slides ->Deployment/ Ressources** (3-4 mins) 

1. **Slides -> How Hayley learned Tableau: 
         - Videos were not helpful for me. Very slow. Tried sitting through their intro course and immediately lost interest. 
         - I needed a task, a specific goal and then off I went. I recommend the same.
